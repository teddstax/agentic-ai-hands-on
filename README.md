# üß† Agentic AI Workshop ‚Äì Customer Support Agent

## üéØ Goal of the workshop
Learn how to build a powerful, intelligent customer support agent using Langflow. You‚Äôll start by creating a simple chatbot with OpenAI, then enrich it with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by connecting it to your own FAQ knowledge base using Astra DB. Finally, you‚Äôll add tools such as order lookups, product info access, calculators, and web tools to make your agent truly agentic‚Äîcapable of reasoning, taking actions, and handling real-world customer support scenarios.

By the end of this workshop, you‚Äôll have a fully functional AI agent that can:
- Answer FAQs using vector-based document search
- Retrieve live order and product details from structured data
- Combine tools (like calculators and lookups) to generate multi-step responses
- Adapt dynamically to user intent‚Äîjust like a real support agent would

![chatbot-flow](./assets/chatbot-flow.png)

üëè Amazing! You just built your first flow. Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What's the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

You'll see the Large Language Model (LLM) answer your question nicely!

### 2. üß≠ Familiarize yourself with Langflow
**Goal:** Understand the main components of Langflow

#### Steps:
1. If still open, close the Playground popup
2. Select `Chat Input` and click `Controls`
3. You'll see a field name `Text`, type `What's the difference between AI and Machine Learning` in the text field. close the popup
4. Select `Chat Output`, the three dots `...` and click `Expand`
5. Do the same with `Chat Input`
6. Click the play button `‚ñ∂Ô∏è` on the `Chat Output` component and see the flow run

Notice the running time of the separate components.  
Click the magnifying glass `üîç` in the `OpenAI` component. This shows you a popup with the intermediate data that is passed to the next component. Very useful for debugging purposes!

### 3. üß† Agentic AI with Langflow
**Goal:** Create an AI Agent that has access to a URL tool and a Calculator tool

![basic-agentic-ai](./assets/basic-agentic-ai.png)

#### Steps:
1. Reproduce the above flow (or load it from [./flows/basic-agentic-ai.json](./flows/basic-agentic-ai.json))
2. Esure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` has been set
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the model is set to `gpt-4o-mini` as this model is better suited to reason as an Agent
4. When adding the `URL` and `Calculator` components to the canvas, select them and click `Tool mode`
5. Connect all the components

üëè Amazing! You just built your first AI Agent. Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What is 2x the value of a Euro in Dollars

You'll get an answer stating a value of $2.16 or something (as of April 2025).

To see the magic behind, simply click the down arrow `üîΩ`. The Agent decided to use two tools:
1. The URL tool to fetch the current exchange rates
2. The Calculator tool to multiply the value by two

![tool-usage](./assets/tool-usage.png)

### 4. üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Astra DB
**Goal:** Adding external knowledge by making use of Vector Search and RAG

#### Preparation: Creating a FAQ collection
In this step we'll create a new collection in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) to store data as a knowledge base.

First we need to create a collection to store the data:
1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `Create Collection +`
3. Type your collection name, i.e. `company_faq` and enebale `Vector-enabled collection`
4. Leave NVIDIA, NV-Embed-QA, 1024 and Cosine as it is
5. Click `Create Collection`

![astra-new-collection](./assets/astra-new-collection.png)

You just created a new empty collection to store knowledge base articles.

#### Steps: Add Astra DB as a RAG tool in Langflow

Extend your existing Basic Agentic AI flow with the following:
1. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
2. Click the component and select `Tool mode`
3. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
4. Click `Edit tools` and update the three `Tool descriptions` by replacing
    - `Ingest and search documents in Astra DB` with
    - `Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about shipping, returns, placing orders, and more.`
    - ![astra-rag-agent](./assets/rag-edit-tools.png)
    - Click `Save`
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è This essential step ensures the Agent understands to use this specific tool to search for FAQs
4. Connect the `Astra DB` component to the `Agent` component

![astra-rag-agent](./assets/astra-rag-agent.png)  
For ease of use, this flow is also available here: [./flows/rag-agentic-ai.json](./flows/rag-agentic-ai.json).

Let's run it by clicking `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and asking the question:

    What are your shipping times?

As a response we get a generic answer. Why? Because our collection is still empty. Let's fix that!

#### Steps: Add some articles to our knowledge base
Extend your flow with the following additional flow (scroll down a bit for a blank piece of canvas):
1. Collapse `Data` and drag `File` to the canvas
2. Click on `Upload a file` and upload [./data/Company_FAQ.pdf](./data/Company_FAQ.pdf) from this repository (you'll have to download it first)
3. Collapse `Langchain` and drag `Recursive Character Splitter` to the canvas
4. Set the `Chunk size` to 500 (because NV-Embed-QA only allows 512 tokens at maximum) and `Chunk overlap` to 100 (so that every chunk has a bit of information from the previous one)
5. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
6. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
7. Click the play button `‚ñ∂Ô∏è` on the `Astra DB` component, see the flow run and observe the time consumed. You can also click the intermediate magnifying glasses `üîç` to debug the flow.

![astra-ingest](./assets/astra-ingest.png)

üôå Congrats! You just loaded a PDF, converted it to plain text, chunked it and loaded it into a Vector enabled collection in Astra DB!

#### üëÄ Check: Have a look at the data in Astra DB
In this step we'll have a look at the dataset in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com).

1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `company_faq`
3. Observe the data loaded into the collection on the right side of the screen
4. Toggle from `Table` to `JSON` view and collapse some of the rows to see what's inside

To see Vector Search in action, type the following in the text box `Vector Search`:

    What are your shipping times

You'll see the chunk with shipping times show up as the first result. You just ran an ANN search transparantly utilizing the Vectorize functionality in Astra DB that does the vectorization for you on demand.

#### üöÄ Now let's run the Agent in Langflow
Click on `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playground` and click on `+` on the left side to start a new Chat. Then run the following question:

    How many hours do I need to wait for a domestic order?

 üéâ You'll see the Agent making use of the Astra DB knowledge base to find relevant content and then running the calculator to calculate the amount of hours to wait.

### 5. üìà Adding structured data
**Goal:** Enable your Agent to retrieve structured order and product details.

#### Preparation: Add Orders data
1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `Create Collection +`
3. Name the collection `orders`, disable the `Vector-enabled collection` switch and click `Create Collection`
4. Click `Load Data` and upload the file: [./data/sample_orders.csv](./sample_orders.csv)
5. Verify the data was loaded into Astra DB

#### Preparation: Add Products data
1. Click `Create Collection +`
2. Name the collection `products`, disable the `Vector-enabled collection` switch and click `Create Collection`
3. Click `Load Data` and upload the file: [./data/sample_products.csv](./sample_products.csv)
4. Verify the data was loaded into Astra DB

#### Steps üõ†Ô∏èüîç: Add Order Lookup to the agent 
1. Return to your Langflow flow
2. Collapse `Tools` and drag `Astra DB Tool` to the canvas
3. Configure as follows:
    - **Tool Name:** `OrderLookup`  
    - **Tool Description:** `A tool used to look up an order based on its ID`   
    - **Collection Name:** `orders`  
    - Ensure `Astra DB Application Token` and `API endpoint` are configured
    - Click `Open Table`, click `+` to add a field and update the field name to `orderNumber`, then click `Save` (this allows the tool to use the orderNumber column for queries)
4. Connect the `Astra DB Tool` component to the `Agent` component

#### Steps üõ†Ô∏èüîç: Add Products Lookup to the agent 
1. Collapse `Tools` and drag `Astra DB Tool` to the canvas
2. Configure as follows:
    - **Tool Name:** `ProductLookup`  
    - **Tool Description:** `A tool used to look up a product based on its ID`   
    - **Collection Name:** `products`  
    - Ensure `Astra DB Application Token` and `API endpoint` are configured
    - Click `Open Table`, click `+` to add a field and update the field name to `productId`, then click `Save` (this allows the tool to use the productId column for queries)
3. Connect the `Astra DB Tool` component to the `Agent` component

#### Steps üí¨: Instruct the Agent
Let's provide our Agent a bit more information about what it's capable of doing and what guardrails to take into account. This enables more accuracy for our Customer Support Agent.

1. On the `Agent` component, click the square at `Agent Instructions`
2. Paste the following instruction:

```text
You are a skilled customer service agent supporting Customer Service Employees to answer questions from customers. Your primary responsibility is to use the available tools to accurately address user inquiries and provide detailed, helpful responses. You can:

- Look up order numbers to retrieve and share order details. Keep in mind that the date is the order date and that price is in USD.
- Access product information to provide relevant descriptions or specifications based on the retrieved product ids.
- Use the Astra DB knowledge base about Frequently Asked Questions on shipping, returns, placing orders, and more. Always use this tool to find relevant content!
- Use the Calculator tool to perform basic arithmetic. Only use the calculator tool!
- Use the URL tool to find known information on the internet or APIs to make the response more accurate.

Think step by step. If answering a question requires multiple tools, combine their outputs to deliver a comprehensive response.
Feel free to iterate a few times!
Example: For an inquiry about canceling an order, retrieve the order and product details, and also reference the FAQ for the cancellation policy.
Example: If there are questiona that require arithmetic, make sure to invoke the Calculator tool.
Example: If there is a need for external up-to-date information, make sure to invoke the URL tool.

Always aim to deliver clear, concise, and user-focused solutions to ensure the best possible experience.
```

![customer-support-agent](./assets/customer-support-agent.png)  
For ease of use, this flow is also available here: [./flows/customer-support-agent.json](./flows/customer-support-agent.json).

ü•≥ You did it! You now have an Agentic Flow with access to:
- A company FAQ knowledgebase
- Orders data
- Product data
- A calculator
- Capability to fetch information from the internet

Let's run some questions. For instance:

- What's the shipping status of order 1001?
- What was ordered with 1003?
- What date will order 1004 arrive?
- How can I cancel order 1001 and what is the shipping policy?
- What's the amount of order 1005 in Euros?
- The customer paid 110 euros for order 1001, how much should we return?

Observe how all the different tools are being used to answer the user's questions.

### 5. üì± Create an external app that call the Langflow REST Endpoint
In this step we'll create a simple Python app that runs the Langflow flow.

#### Steps: Use the Langflow API endpoint in Python
1. In Langflow exit the Playground and click on `Publish` in the right top corner and then click `API Access`
2. Click on `Python`
3. Copy the code and paste it in a new file called `flow.py`
4. Change the input value on line 6 to something like *How can I cancel order 1001 and what is the shipping policy?*
5. Save the file

![langflow-python-api](./assets/langflow-python-api.png)

Let's run it!

```bash
uv run flow.py
```

As a response you'll see a JSON structure that contains the actual answer and additonal metadata.  
The answer you're probably looking for is located inside the JSONPath `$.outputs[0].outputs[0].results.message.text`.

If you change line 22 to the following, you'll see the actual response: `print(response.json()['outputs'][0]['outputs'][0]['results']['message']['text'])`

### 6. ü§© Add a visual front-end
In this step we'll use a simple Streamlit app that supports Customer Support Agents.

#### Steps: Configure the Langflow FLOW_ID
1. Open `app.py`
2. Update line 9 to the `FLOW_ID` of your flow, you can find the Flow ID in Langflow by clicking on `Publish->API Access` and taking the ID after `.../run/`
3. Save the file

In order to run the app:
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```
