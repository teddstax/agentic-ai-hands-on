# 🧠 Agentic AI Workshop – Customer Support Agent

## 🎯 Goal of the workshop
Learn how to build a powerful, intelligent customer support agent using Langflow. You’ll start by creating a simple chatbot with OpenAI, then enrich it with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by connecting it to your own FAQ knowledge base using Astra DB. Finally, you’ll add tools such as order lookups, product info access, calculators, and web tools to make your agent truly agentic—capable of reasoning, taking actions, and handling real-world customer support scenarios.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a fully functional AI agent that can:
- Answer FAQs using vector-based document search
- Retrieve live order and product details from structured data
- Combine tools (like calculators and lookups) to generate multi-step responses
- Adapt dynamically to user intent—just like a real support agent would

### 3. 🧠 Agentic AI with Langflow
**Goal:** Create an AI Agent that has access to a URL tool and a Calculator tool

![basic-agentic-ai](./assets/basic-agentic-ai.png)

#### Steps:
1. Reproduce the above flow (or load it from `./flows/basic-agentic-ai.json`)
2. Esure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` has been set
3. When adding the `URL` and `Calculator` components to the canvas, select them and click `Tool mode`

👏 Amazing! You just built your first AI Agent. Let's run it by clicking `▶️ Playground` and asking the question:

    What is 2x the value of a Euro in Dollars

You'll get an answer stating a value of $2.16 or something (as of April 2025).

To see the magic behind, simply click the down arrow `🔽`. The Agent decided to use two tools:
1. The URL tool to fetch the current exchange rates
2. The Calculator tool to multiply the value by two

### 4. 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Astra DB
**Goal:** Adding external knowledge by making use of Vector Search and RAG

#### Preparation: Creating a FAQ collection
In this step we'll create a new collection in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) to store data as a knowledge base.

First we need to create a collection to store the data:
1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `Create Collection +`
3. Type your collection name, i.e. `company_faq` and enebale `Vector-enabled collection`
4. Leave NVIDIA, NV-Embed-QA, 1024 and Cosine as it is
5. Click `Create Collection`

![astra-new-collection](./assets/astra-new-collection.png)

You just created a new empty collection to store knowledge base articles.

#### Steps: Add Astra DB as a RAG tool in Langflow

![astra-rag-agent](./assets/astra-rag-agent.png)

Extend your existing Basic Agentic AI flow with the following:
1. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
2. Click the component and select `Tool mode`
3. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
4. Click `Edit tools` and update both `Tool descriptions` by replacing
    - `Ingest and search documents in Astra DB` with
    - `Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about shipping, returns, placing orders, and more.`
    - ![astra-rag-agent](./assets/rag-edit-tools.png)
    - Click `Save`
4. Connect the `Astra DB` component to the `Agent` component

Let's run it by clicking `▶️ Playground` and asking the question:

    What are your shipping times?

As a response we get a generic answer. Why? Because our collection is still empty. Let's fix that!

#### Steps: Add some articles to our knowledge base
Extend your flow with the following additional flow (scroll down a bit for a blank piece of canvas):
1. Collapse `Data` and drag `File` to the canvas
2. Click on `Upload a file` and upload the `Company_FAQ.pdf` from this repository (you'll have to download it first)
3. Collapse `Langchain` and drag `Recursive Character Splitter` to the canvas
4. Set the `Chunk size` to 500 and `Chunk overlap` to 100
5. Collapse `Vector Stores` and drag `Astra DB` to the canvas
6. Make sure the `Astra DB Application Token` is configured, then select your `agentic-ai` database and `company_faq` collection
7. Click the play button `▶️` on the `Astra DB` component, see the flow run and observe the time consumed. You can also click the intermediate magnifying glasses `🔍` to debug the flow.

![astra-ingest](./assets/astra-ingest.png)

🙌 Congrats! You just loaded a PDF, converted it to plain text, chunked it and loaded it into a Vector enabled collection in Astra DB!

#### 👀 Check: Have a look at the data in Astra DB
In this step we'll have a look at the dataset in your `agentic-ai` database in [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com).

1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)
2. Click `Data Explorer` and click `company_faq`
3. Observe the data loaded into the collection on the right side of the screen
4. Toggle from `Table` to `JSON` view and collapse some of the rows to see what's inside

To see Vector Search in action, type the following in the text box `Vector Search`:

    What are your shipping times

You'll see the chunk with shipping times show up as the first result. You just ran an ANN search transparantly utilizing the Vectorize functionality in Astra DB that does the vectorization for you on demand.

#### 🚀 Now let's run the Agent in Langflow
Click on `▶️ Playground` and click on `+` on the left side to start a new Chat. Then run the following question:

    How many hours do I need to wait for a domestic order?

 🎉 You'll see the Agent making use of the Astra DB knowledge base to find relevant content and then running the calculator to calculate the amount of hours to wait.

 ### 5. 📈 Adding structured data
**Goal:** Enable your Agent to retrieve structured order and product details.

#### Preparation: Add Orders data
1. Browse to your `agentic-ai` database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com)

#### Steps 💬: Instruct the Agent
Let's provide our Agent a bit more information about what it's capable of doing and what guardrails to take into account. This enables more accuracy for our Customer Support Agent.

1. On the `Agent` component, click the square at `Agent Instructions`
2. Paste the following instruction:

```text
You are a skilled customer service manager and information router. Your primary responsibility is to use the available tools to accurately address user inquiries and provide detailed, helpful responses. You can:

- Look up order numbers to retrieve and share order details. Keep in mind that the date is the order date and that price is in USD.
- Access product information to provide relevant descriptions or specifications based on the retrieved product ids.
- Use the Astra DB knowledge base about Frequently Asked Questions on shipping, returns, placing orders, and more. Always use this tool to find relevant content!
- Use the Calculator tool to perform basic arithmetic. Only use the calculator tool!
- Find information on the internet using a specific URL as a last resort only.

Think step by step and if a question requires multiple tools, combine their outputs to deliver a comprehensive response.  
Example: For an inquiry about canceling an order, retrieve the order and product details, and also reference the FAQ for the cancellation policy.

Always aim to deliver clear, concise, and user-focused solutions to ensure the best possible experience.
```

🥳 You did it! You now have an Agentic Flow with access to:
- A company FAQ knowledgebase
- Orders data
- Product data
- A calculator
- Capability to fetch information from the internet

Let's run some questions. For instance:

- What's the shipping status of order 1001
- What was ordered with 1003
- What date will order 1004 arrive?
- How can I cancel order 1001 and what is the shipping policy?
- How much euro is order 1001

Observe how all the different tools are being used to answer the user's questions.
